Mon 12 Jan
  - read Syllabus
  - download matlab and relevant toolboxes (links in Moodle)
Wed 14 Jan
  - Download a syntax-aware text editor (example options linked in Moodle)
  - make a github account/username
Fri 16 Jan
  - Make a github repository called "GEOL4002_YourName" and add me ("lsugeo") as collaborator
    (might want to use Github Desktop for creating and push/pulls, 
    adding collaborator must be done on github in your web browser)
  - Watch intro videos as needs be to get basics of git, github, Github Desktop, and MATLAB
    (videos linked in Moodle)
Mon 19 Jan
  - No Class, MLK day
Wed 21 Jan
  - Read Blewitt et al., 2018 EOS article (linked in Moodle)
  - poke around NGL site (linked in Moodle)
Fri 23 Jan
  - download data from station P403.  Write a matlab script to load, parse, and plot all 3 
    components of the position time series (eastings, northings, and vertical) as individual points 
  - Bonus (required for grad students):  make your plots better
  	  - add axis labels, title, grid lines
  	  - try different colors, line markers, connecting line styles
  	  - use subplot to plot all 3 axes in a single figure window
  - Bonus Bonus (not required, but I think you can do it):
  		- identify the data columns for uncertainties in position
      - use errorbar to plot the errorbars associated with each point
  - Push your script to your github repository by 12 pm (noon) on Monday
Mon 26 Jan
  - Same homework, but do it even better this time!
Wed 28 Jan
  - add to/clean up your existing script...
  - for station P403, fit a line to your E, N, and V data (use polyfit)
      - the  slope of each line is the velocity value in that direction
  - plot the best fit line on top of the raw E, N, V timeseries
      - use the original x-axis values from the data points, use polyval to get the y-axis values
      - might need to stop plotting the errorbars if the figure gets too busy looking
  - determine the horizontal velocity magnitude and direction (degrees East of North) for P403
      - ask yourself: do these values make sense for tectonic motion in the Pacific Nortwest US?
  - subtract your best fit line values from your original data (these are the "residuals")
  - make another plot with just the residuals
      - use labels/titles to keep your results figures organized and clear
  - Read the Wikipedia article on Episodic Tremor and Slip
      - stare at your data... do you see it????
